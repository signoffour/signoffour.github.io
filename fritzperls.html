<h1 style="text-align:center"> Fritz Perls : Gestalt Therapy </h1>

<p style="color:red">Maxine (Emergence of Kali)</p>

Maxine: My dream is that I'm at home at my parents' house and...</br></br>

Fritz: Well, will you first play your voice. "I am Maxine's voice. I am loud, soft, droning, musical, I'm
alive...</br></br>

M: I am Maxine's voice and I am very lifeless little feeling in it, and I feel very different than my voice represents.</br></br>

F: Okeh, then have an encounter with your voice. Put your voice here, and you sit there. You say, 
"Voice, I have no relationship with you. You're different from me."</br></br>

M: Voice, you're different from me. I feel altogether different from—from—from the way you sound. I'm nervous, I'm trembling, and I'm scared to death...</br></br>

F: That's what you feel.</br></br>

M: My stomach is - my stomach - is jumpy.</br></br>

F: Okeh, now be your voice.</br></br>

M: I I know that you don't - you don't want me to - to, uh - to express how you really feel, so I'm helping you to cover it up.</br></br>

F: Now, write a script, which means you change chairs, with every sentence or whenever you feel like answering back. Now the voice says to Maxine, 
"I want to cover up what you feel," right?</br></br>

M: But I don't want you to cover up what I feel. I want to - I want you to let my feelings out, I want you to -</br></br>

F: Say this again. "I want you to let my feeUngs out."</br></br>

M: (more lively) I want you to let my feelings out, I want you to let me be a person.</br></br>

F: Again.</br></br>

M: I'm sick and tired of—of you covering up for me all the time. I want - I wanna be myself.</br></br>

F: Say that again, "I want to be myself." </br></br>

M: I want to be myself. </br></br>

F: Again.</br></br>

M: I would like to be myself, voice! I want you to stop covering up for me. </br></br>

F: Again. </br></br>

M: I want to be a genuine person. </br></br>

F: Again.</br></br>

M: I wanna be myself! Stop covering up for me!</br></br>

F: Let me work on a hunch. Say this to Brian, (fiance) M: Stop covering up for me...</br></br>

F: Feel it?</br></br>

M: No. I'm scared to say it.</br></br>

F: Say this to him...

M: Don't cover up for me.

F: Okeh, close your eyes again. Qose your eyes again and enter your body. What do you experience?</br></br>

M: Very nervous. My legs are shaking, and my arms are shaking, and my stomach is nervous.</br></br>

F: Dance nervousness. Express all that you feel now in movements.</br></br>

M: I feel sort of tight, in my - </br></br>

F: Yah. (Fritz holds out his arm) Now tighten me, tighten it more-more-more. Implode me... So what do you feel now?...</br></br>

M: I feel more relaxed.</br></br>

F: Ahah. Because you did to me what you usually do to yourself. This is the golden rule in Gestalt Therapy:
"Do unto others what you do unto yourself." I think we are ready for the dream now, so let's have the dream. </br></br>

M: I was home, and I'm - I'm with my sister, and - and we have a lot of fun together.</br></br>

F: In the dream?</br></br>

M: Yeah. What kind of fun?</br></br>

M: We talk together, we do things together, we - </br></br>

F: What do you do together? You see, I can't understand abstract language. I must have something real to work with. </br></br>

M: We-we escape together, we -</br></br>

F: You escape together.</br></br>

M: We escape from people, and </br></br>

F: I don't understand the word "people." From whom do you escape?</br></br>

M: From my parents.</br></br>

F: Ah. And that's fun.</br></br>

M: It's fun. And we understand each other. I can tell her - I can take out my hostility on her, I can scream at her, and pick at her. I can't do that to my parents. All
I can do is be just - just lifeless with them, just listen to them.</br></br>

F: Okeh. Have an encounter with your sister.</br></br>

M: You're a bum. You're no good. I'm better than you are...</br></br>

F: Change seats. What does she answer?</br></br>

M: I don't Uke being called a bum.</br></br>

F: Say this again.</br></br>

M: (louder) I don't like being called a bum.</br></br>

F: Again.</br></br>

M: (animated) I don't like being called a bum!</br></br>

F: Again.</br></br>

M: I'm sick and tired of you calling me a bum all the time!</br></br>

F: Now you sound real. Do you hear it?</br></br>

M: I don't Uke you for it, (high, petulant voice) and I hate you, I don't</br></br>

F: I don't believe the hate. "I hate you." I didn't hear any hate in there. You're talking literature again.</br></br>

M: You're the bum.</br></br>

F: Ah! Say this again.</br></br>

M: You're a bum, you're a bum, I'm not the bum. You're the bum.</br></br>

F: Change seats... What do you experience now?</br></br>

M: I - I feel like I would like to tear her apart. I'd like to tear her clothes off, and her legs off, and I'd just like to smash her to pieces.</br></br>

F: Now do it - dance this. Act it out.</br></br>

M: I can't act it out.</br></br>

F: Do it! Don't give me that crap... You could squeeze me very nicely. Do we have anything she could tear apart? (someone gets some newspapers) And breathe
when you do this, and make noises. Make noises.</br></br>

M: I can't tear you apart, Norma. . . I would like to, but</br></br>

F: Yah? What's your objection? </br></br>

M: I—I—You're not the one I'm reaUy angry at.</br></br>

F: Ahah.</br></br>

M: I don't want to hurt you.</br></br>

F: How don't you want to hurt her? (laughter)</br></br>

M: You're not the one—I don't want to kill you. I don't want to tear you apart. I don't wanna—to make a
vegetable out of you. Not kill you physically, but I don't wanna</br></br>
—
F: Whom do you want to kill?</br></br>

M: (softly) I'd like to kill my father.</br></br>
