<p style="color:red">Maxine (Emergence of Kali)</p>

Maxine: My dream is that I'm at home at my parents' house and...</br></br>

Fritz: Well, will you first play your voice. "I am Maxine's voice. I am loud, soft, droning, musical, I'm
alive...</br></br>

M: I am Maxine's voice and I am very lifeless little feeling in it, and I feel very different than my voice represents.</br></br>

F: Okeh, then have an encounter with your voice. Put your voice here, and you sit there. You say, 
"Voice, I have no relationship with you. You're different from me."</br></br>

M: Voice, you're different from me. I feel altogether different from—from—from the way you sound. I'm nervous, I'm trembling, and I'm scared to death...</br></br>

F: That's what you feel.</br></br>

M: My stomach is - my stomach - is jumpy.</br></br>

F: Okeh, now be your voice.</br></br>

M: I I know that you don't - you don't want me to - to, uh - to express how you really feel, so I'm helping you to cover it up.</br></br>

F: Now, write a script, which means you change chairs, with every sentence or whenever you feel like answering back. Now the voice says to Maxine, 
"I want to cover up what you feel," right?</br></br>

M: But I don't want you to cover up what I feel. I want to - I want you to let my feelings out, I want you to -</br></br>

F: Say this again. "I want you to let my feeUngs out."</br></br>
