<h1 style="text-align:center"> Fritz Perls : Gestalt Therapy </h1>

<p style="color:red">Maxine</p>

Maxine: My dream is that I'm at home at my parents' house and...</br></br>

Fritz: Well, will you first play your voice. "I am Maxine's voice. I am loud, soft, droning, musical, I'm
alive...</br></br>

M: I am Maxine's voice and I am very lifeless little feeling in it, and I feel very different than my voice represents.</br></br>

F: Okeh, then have an encounter with your voice. Put your voice here, and you sit there. You say, 
"Voice, I have no relationship with you. You're different from me."</br></br>

M: Voice, you're different from me. I feel altogether different from—from—from the way you sound. I'm nervous, I'm trembling, and I'm scared to death...</br></br>

F: That's what you feel.</br></br>

M: My stomach is - my stomach - is jumpy.</br></br>

F: Okeh, now be your voice.</br></br>

M: I I know that you don't - you don't want me to - to, uh - to express how you really feel, so I'm helping you to cover it up.</br></br>

F: Now, write a script, which means you change chairs, with every sentence or whenever you feel like answering back. Now the voice says to Maxine, 
"I want to cover up what you feel," right?</br></br>

M: But I don't want you to cover up what I feel. I want to - I want you to let my feelings out, I want you to -</br></br>

F: Say this again. "I want you to let my feeUngs out."</br></br>

M: (more lively) I want you to let my feelings out, I want you to let me be a person.</br></br>

F: Again.</br></br>

M: I'm sick and tired of—of you covering up for me all the time. I want - I wanna be myself.</br></br>

F: Say that again, "I want to be myself." </br></br>

M: I want to be myself. </br></br>

F: Again.</br></br>

M: I would like to be myself, voice! I want you to stop covering up for me. </br></br>

F: Again. </br></br>

M: I want to be a genuine person. </br></br>

F: Again.</br></br>

M: I wanna be myself! Stop covering up for me!</br></br>

F: Let me work on a hunch. Say this to Brian, (fiance) M: Stop covering up for me...</br></br>

F: Feel it?</br></br>

M: No. I'm scared to say it.</br></br>

F: Say this to him...</br></br>

M: Don't cover up for me.</br></br>

F: Okeh, close your eyes again. Qose your eyes again and enter your body. What do you experience?</br></br>

M: Very nervous. My legs are shaking, and my arms are shaking, and my stomach is nervous.</br></br>

F: Dance nervousness. Express all that you feel now in movements.</br></br>

M: I feel sort of tight, in my - </br></br>

F: Yah. (Fritz holds out his arm) Now tighten me, tighten it more-more-more. Implode me... So what do you feel now?...</br></br>

M: I feel more relaxed.</br></br>

F: Ahah. Because you did to me what you usually do to yourself. This is the golden rule in Gestalt Therapy:
"Do unto others what you do unto yourself." I think we are ready for the dream now, so let's have the dream. </br></br>

M: I was home, and I'm - I'm with my sister, and - and we have a lot of fun together.</br></br>

F: In the dream?</br></br>

M: Yeah. What kind of fun?</br></br>

M: We talk together, we do things together, we - </br></br>

F: What do you do together? You see, I can't understand abstract language. I must have something real to work with. </br></br>

M: We-we escape together, we -</br></br>

F: You escape together.</br></br>

M: We escape from people, and </br></br>

F: I don't understand the word "people." From whom do you escape?</br></br>

M: From my parents.</br></br>

F: Ah. And that's fun.</br></br>

M: It's fun. And we understand each other. I can tell her - I can take out my hostility on her, I can scream at her, and pick at her. I can't do that to my parents. All
I can do is be just - just lifeless with them, just listen to them.</br></br>

F: Okeh. Have an encounter with your sister.</br></br>

M: You're a bum. You're no good. I'm better than you are...</br></br>

F: Change seats. What does she answer?</br></br>

M: I don't Uke being called a bum.</br></br>

F: Say this again.</br></br>

M: (louder) I don't like being called a bum.</br></br>

F: Again.</br></br>

M: (animated) I don't like being called a bum!</br></br>

F: Again.</br></br>

M: I'm sick and tired of you calling me a bum all the time!</br></br>

F: Now you sound real. Do you hear it?</br></br>

M: I don't Uke you for it, (high, petulant voice) and I hate you, I don't</br></br>

F: I don't believe the hate. "I hate you." I didn't hear any hate in there. You're talking literature again.</br></br>

M: You're the bum.</br></br>

F: Ah! Say this again.</br></br>

M: You're a bum, you're a bum, I'm not the bum. You're the bum.</br></br>

F: Change seats... What do you experience now?</br></br>

M: I - I feel like I would like to tear her apart. I'd like to tear her clothes off, and her legs off, and I'd just like to smash her to pieces.</br></br>

F: Now do it - dance this. Act it out.</br></br>

M: I can't act it out.</br></br>

F: Do it! Don't give me that crap... You could squeeze me very nicely. Do we have anything she could tear apart? (someone gets some newspapers) And breathe
when you do this, and make noises. Make noises.</br></br>

M: I can't tear you apart, Norma. . . I would like to, but</br></br>

F: Yah? What's your objection? </br></br>

M: I—I—You're not the one I'm reaUy angry at.</br></br>

F: Ahah.</br></br>

M: I don't want to hurt you.</br></br>

F: How don't you want to hurt her? (laughter)</br></br>

M: You're not the one—I don't want to kill you. I don't want to tear you apart. I don't wanna—to make a
vegetable out of you. Not kill you physically, but I don't wanna</br></br>
—
F: Whom do you want to kill?</br></br>

M: (softly) I'd like to kill my father.</br></br>

F: Okeh. Let's call Papa in. (Fritz whistles) You know, of course, parents are never good, parents are always at fault. If they are tall, they should be small. If they
are that, they should be this. So, tell him off. How does he not fit your expectations? What should he be like?</br></br>

M: He should let me alone.</br></br>

F: Say this to him.</br></br>

M: (petulant, complaining) Let me alone, Dad. Go away from me. Let me alone. Let me have my own life and just stop interfering, and leave me alone.</br></br>

F: Does he hear you?</br></br>

M:No.</br></br>

F: So try again. Get communication.</br></br>

M: I-I feel very sad—when I tell you this.</br></br>

F: Say this to him.</br></br>

M: I feel sad when I tell you this, because I really don't want to hurt you. I feel guUty when I try to hurt you.</br></br>

F: We translate the word "guilty" in Gestalt Therapy by resentful, so let's try this on for size. How do you call him?</br></br>

M: Dad.</br></br>

F: "Dad, I resent this and this - I resent this and this."</br></br>

M: Dad, I resent - I resent your trying to make me fill your needs</br></br>

F: Such as</br></br>

M: I resent your telling me where to hve, what to do, because I know that the only reason you tell me this is because of - because of your own needs. You want me to
live near you. You want me to. . . </br></br>

F: What are you blocking, right now? </br></br>

M: I'm trying to think - I'm trying to think how to word what he wants me to do.</br></br>

F: Okeh, play him. Let him say, "Maxine, I want you to Uve near me...</br></br>

M: All that I want from you, Max - All that I've given to you, I've done so much for you - All that I want from you in return is to be a good daughter. I want you
to do what other people do. I want you to - I want you to practice pharmacy, this is what your degree is in, but instead you're throwing it all away. If you would 
do this, by the time you're forty, you could retire, you could have all the money you want, (laughter)</br></br>

M: I don't want to be a pharmacist. I never did want to be a pharmacist.</br></br>

F: Play Papa again.</br></br>

M: I never told you to study pharmacy. You can do anything you want to. I don't care what you do. All I told you is to do something where you make a lotta
money and you have a good reputation.</br></br>

F: Can you do something phony? Yah?</br></br>

M: Yes.</br></br>

F: Go on playing Papa, and then go back and each time you answer, "Fuck you!" (laughter)</br></br>

M: Each time I answer my father, I say, "Fuck you"?</br></br>

F: Yes. Right. He is sermonizing, isn't he? So let him preach, and each time he tries to bullshit you into something, tell him "Fuck you."</br></br>

M: I'm a sick man, and - and - I just can't put up with - with the way you treat me. You're gonna kill me.</br></br>

F: Now he changed his tune. Now he plays the tragedy queen, (laughter) Tell him that</br></br>

M: Dad, you're playing the tragedy queen. You play the poor helpless old man, "Feel sorry for me." - That's what you tell me. "Feel sorry for me." A weak old man.
I - I'm sick and tired of it. I - I can't help it if you're a weak old man if that's what you are. (snores) He falls asleep, (laughter) Goddamit, Dad, I'm so mad 
at you - every time I wanna express anything or tell you anything, you completely — you won't you won't even listen to anything - anything I have to say is irresponsible
-</br></br>

F: Put more - put your whole self into it.</br></br>

M: Anything I ever have to say to you, you consider irresponsible, not worthwhile</br></br>

F: (mimicking her tone) Nyahnyahnyahnyah.</br></br>

M: Nyahnyahnyah, I'm getting sick and tired of being treated like a child. I'm not a child!</br></br>

F: Well, your voice doesn't tell it, doesn't say so. Your voice is the voice of a petulant child. Try my medicine. Tell him "Fuck you."</br></br>

M: Fuck you, you old bastard, (roars of laughter and applause) How can you say such terrible things to your father! I never said those things. I never brought you up
to talk that way. You're going to the dogs - it's all the education you've been getting, (laughter) You're a narrow - minded - You're so narrowminded you can't see anything,
except </br></br>

F: Nyahnyahnyahnyah. </br></br>

M: your own way.</br></br>

F: Nyahhh. Do you hear your voice? Okeh, go on talking to him, but hsten to your voice.</br></br>

M: I wish I could tell you what I really thought of you.</br></br>

F: Yah. This sounded real. Say this again.</br></br>

M: I wish I could tell you what I really thought of you.</br></br>

F: Who prevents you? He isn't here. He isn't here in reality. Take the risk. . .</br></br>

M: If you wouldn't die, and blame it on me, I - I'd really tell you a few things.</br></br>

F: Okeh. He is dead, now.</br></br>

M: Thank God! (laughter)</br></br>

F: Now you can talk real.</br></br>

M: I feel like it's all my fault that he died.</br></br>

F: Oh, this is his voice. Come on, switch. I want to hear what he says. "It's all your fault."</br></br>

M: It's all your fault. I was - I was sick and helpless. I've got all kinds of diseases, I've got all kinds of ailments, and because you shout at me, because you make me
— because you won't - uh — because you're ungrateful, because you won't help me, because you wouldn't be with me when I needed you, I died. And it's your fault</br></br>

F: Okeh, switch. "It's my fault."</br></br>

M: Yeah. So I'm a slob. Does that make you happ now? Do you feel proud of me? Is that what you want? Think your daughter's a slob? O.K. I admit it, I'm a slob,
and I'm gonna go on being a slob, too. Well, I showed you. I died, and you'll be sorry. Someday you'll be sorry.</br></br>

F: Again.</br></br>

M: You'll be sorry someday.</br></br>

F: When?</br></br>

M: Someday you'll be sorry when you realize - when you grow up and reaUze how you have treated me when you realize that all because of you, I died, you're
going to be sorry.</br></br>

F: Okeh. Now say this to someone in the audience. Say this to Brian, (fiance) Put it on for size. . . "One day, you'll be sorry, for how you mistreated me."
(laughter)</br></br>

M: (laughs nervously) Please don't laugh at me. (clears throat) Someday you're going to be sorry for it. You'll be sorry, because—because you didn't treat me
right. You'll lose me.</br></br>

F: Tell him what you resent about him. . . What do you experience now?</br></br>

M: I feel—uh—shy—and—like I—like I have no right to talk with you. (sighs)</br></br>

F: What do you feel? What do you experience? What do you feel physically?</br></br>

M: Lifeless, nothingness. Death. I feel like I have no reason to live. . .</br></br>

F: So instead of going forward, you go back, yah? Okeh, come back to me. How do you feel about me?</br></br>

M: I'm scared of you.</br></br>

F: What do you want to do to me?</br></br>

M: I'd like to be your friend.</br></br>

F: Well, if you are scared, that means you project some aggression on me.</br></br>

M: I'm afraid you'll get too close to me.</br></br>

F: Ahah. How close can I come?</br></br>

M: I don't know, (laughs) That's what I'm scared of.</br></br>

F: Okeh, let's go back and say this to Papa. . .</br></br>

M: Daddy, I'm scared you'll get too close to me. And I'm afraid you'll get your hooks into me. I'm afraid that you'd just make me a blob - a nothing. . .</br></br>

F: So play that Papa, "I'm going to get hooks into you."</br></br>

M: I'm going to getcha.</br></br>

F: Yah. This is where your power is now. Come on. Play the witch.</br></br>

M: (strongly) I'm stronger than you are. I'm gonna get you, and I'm going to put you in a cage, for life, (hands outstretched and clutching)</br></br>

F: Well, this looks more like strangling.</br></br>

M: I'm gonna strangle you... </br></br>

F: Yah. I'm gonna make you just like your mother. I'm gonna make you - I'm gonna reduce you to the level of - I'm gonna make
you ]ust what I want you to be. You're gonna fulfill just you're gonna fulfill all my needs. You're gonna be my slave. I'm gonna 
take all feeling away from you, untill the only thing you feel is what I feel, and the only thing that you're receptive to are my 
feelings, and—and—you take care of my feehngs. Forget about yours. They aren't important. They're immature. They're childish.</br></br>

F: How do you feel in that role, as the manipulator?</br></br>

M: I don't like it.</br></br>

F: Do you feel any strength?</br></br>

M: Yes.</br></br>

F: Do you recognize yourself as the manipulator? (she shakes her head) No. Then it's of no value... What
do you experience now?... </br></br>

M: I am angry at my father.</br></br>

F: Okeh.</br></br>

M: You're not gonna do this to me, Dad. I'm not gonna letcha.</br></br>

F: Say this again.</br></br>

M: (louder) You're not gonna do this to me.</br></br>

F: I still don't hear any anger. I still hear complaining. Nyahnyahnyah. So far, all the strength is still in him, and you're still on the defensive.</br></br>

M: Dad, I'm not gonna let you do this to me. I don't know - I can't stop you when you're around me. If I can't stop you when you're around me, I'm just gonna
get away from you. I'm gonna put the distance between us - the miles between us - so great that you can't do this to me. I'm not gonna let you. If I have to 
run away from you, that's what I'm gonna do.</br></br>

F: Say this, "I won't let you-</br></br>

M: I won't let you.</br></br>

F: Louder.</br></br>

M: I won't let you!</br></br> 

F: Louder.</br></br>

M: Goddamit! (screams) I won't let you!</br></br>

F: Louder. Say it with your whole body.</br></br>

M: I WON'T LET YOU!</br></br>

F: Again, I still don't believe you. It's all literature still—wailing, complaining... I don't feel any confidence yet.</br></br>

M: I can't say it louder.</br></br>

F: He's still the stronger one.</br></br>

M: Then I'll run away from him.</br></br>

F: Yah. Now this is something you still have to work through - to really stand up to him. Not like a cry-baby, but as a grown-up woman.</br></br>

M: I know what you mean. Thank you.</br></br>
